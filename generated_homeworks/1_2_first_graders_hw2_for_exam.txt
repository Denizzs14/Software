1- Write a method called "getFibonacciBetween" that takes two integer parameters and
 a boolean as input.
if the boolean input is false,
	the method has to return an array with all integers in the Fibonacci
	 sequence that are between the two integers provided as the parameter.
if the boolean input iz true,
	the method has to return an array with all integers in the Fibonacci
	 sequence that are between two such integers that they are the Xth and
	 Yth members of the Fibonacci sequence. (X and Y being the two integer
	 inputs)

(if the boolean is false, and if the input integers are in the Fib seq.,
 then they should also be included in the array.)
(the 1st integer is 0, the 2nd integer is 1, and so on. And the Xth and
 Yth integers are included.)

Example:
	getFibonacciBetween(15,67, false)
	returns [21, 34, 55]

	getFibonacciBetween(4,9,true)
	returns [2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]




2- Write a method called "sortTheSquaresFirst" that takes an array of integers as input.
	returns a new array that is sorted from smallest to largest,
	but the first elements of the array have to be the elements that are square
	 numbers.
	So what is required is that the square numbers will be sorted from smallest
	 to largest first, then the non-square numbers will be sorted the same way.

Example:
	sortTheSquaresFirst([2, 17, 4, 9, 55, 5, 12, 1, 3, 34])
	returns [1, 4, 9, 2, 3, 5, 12, 17, 34, 55]
