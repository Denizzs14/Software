1- Write a program that will take an input from the user.
The input will be an integer.

Then, find out if it is divisible by 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9, in order.
You need to print if the number is divisible or not. Use the following printing method:

Example: input is: 246
The number is divisible by 2.
The number is divisible by 3.
The number is not divisible by 4.
The number is not divisible by 5.
The number is divisible by 6.
The number is not divisible by 7.
The number is not divisible by 8.
The number is not divisible by 9.




2- Write a program that will take two inputs (integers) from the user.
The first will be a large number, and the second will be either 2, 3, 4 or 5.
The program will check if the first number is a power of the second number.
(power = üs, yani x ve y sayılarını girdiysen x = y^a şekline yazılabiliyor mu diye kontrol edecek)

If the first number is not a power of the second number, Then it will print
"The number X is not a power of Y."
If it is a power of the second number, then the program will find out the logarithm y of x. (logy(x))

Example: first input: 153
second input: 4
The number 153 is not a power of 4.

Example 2: first input: 1024
second input: 2
The number 1024 is the 10th power of the number 2.

(do not care about the "th" part, if it is 1st, 2nd or 3rd, it is fine to have 1th 2th 3th.)
