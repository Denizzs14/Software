Write a program that asks for some inputs to the user.
The program will take the first input as an integer.
The second will be a string.


The inputs will be from 1 to 31 and from January to December.

The program will calculate what day it is, and print:
"The day for the date 'INPUTS' is 'DATE'."

For example, If the user inputs 17 and December, the output will be:
"The day for the date 12 December 2018 is Monday."

(Only do for 2018, no other years are necessary.)
