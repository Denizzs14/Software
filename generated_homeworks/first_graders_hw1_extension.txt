Write a method called "reverseInteger" that takes a long integer (less than
 the maximum allowed) *as an integer* and returns a new integer where all
 digits are reversed.

Example:
	input: 14667049
	output: 94976641

It is not allowed to turn the input into a String or to use char. You have to
 do mathematical operations.
