1- Write a program called "FileSorter" that takes inputs from a file -all the inputs are integers, but each input will be in a new line-. (The input file name is also an input the user will enter in the console)
The First input will tell you how many integers you should have for this data set.
The Second input will be either 1 or 2, nothing else.
The rest of the inputs will be random integers.

The input should be entered into an array.
Then the array will be sorted from the smallest to the largest if the Second input is 1,
otherwise it will be sorted from the largest to the smallest.

Then, the output data will be saved into a new file, if the input file name is "ABCD.txt", the output file name should be "new_ABCD.txt".
(BONUS points if the sorting is done with a method)

Example:
Enter a file name to read from: "file.txt"
(file.txt has the below data)
10
2
2
5
4
7
3
7
4
8
0
7
(the output file name will be "new_file.txt", and the data should be as below)
8
7
7
7
5
4
4
3
2

2- (taken from: https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/task/pokemon-evolution/)
Write a program called PokemonCalculator that takes a line (String).
The String will be composed of 4 integers such as "5 10 2 1". We'll call it "N M X Y".
N is the number of pokémon the user has,
M is the number of pokémon candy bars the user has.
X is the number of candy bars needed to evolve a pokémon,
Y is the number of candy bars the user will get if they sell one pokémon.

You can only evolve a pokémon once, and you can not sell an evolved pokémon.

The program should calculate how many pokémon (maximum number) can be evolved in this setting.

Example:
####	N M X Y		output
1	5 10 2 1	5
2	3 10 4 2	2
3	10 3 1 1	6
