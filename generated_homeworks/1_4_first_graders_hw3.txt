1- Write a method called Power that takes 2 inputs, a and k (Both integers).
The implementation should take and return the kth power of a (a^k).
The implementation has to be recursive.


2- Write a method called SortRec that takes an array of integers as an input
 and one input which is the starting index. The method should sort the array
 from smallest to the largest starting from the provided index.
 The implementation has to be recursive.



3- do first_graders_hw1_extension, but with recursion.


4- do first_graders_hw1 question 3, but with recursion.
